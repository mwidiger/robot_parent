# Rails 7 API Demo - Robot Parent

This is a demo application for using chatGBT to answer parenting questions.  Users must specify children that they have.  Requests to chatGBT include children information for context, to tailor responses to particular age group.

Don't use parenting advice this thing generates.  It's a toy, not an advisor.  It's purpose is to demonstrate certain technical capabilities. :)
